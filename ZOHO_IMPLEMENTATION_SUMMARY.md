## Testing Checklist

### Payment Events
- [ ] Test payment failure sends `Payment_Failed` to Zoho
- [ ] Test renewal payment failure sends both `Payment_Failed` and `Renewal_Failed`
- [ ] Test renewal success sends `Renewal` field

### Trial Events
- [ ] Test trial creation sends `FreeTrial_Mandate_Setup`
- [ ] Verify `Trial_Start_Date` and `Trial_End_Date` are correct

### Cancellation Events
- [ ] Test cancellation request sends `Trial_Cancel_Requested` and reason
- [ ] Test actual cancellation (when effective date reached) sends `Refunded_Cancelled`

### Refund Events
- [ ] Test refund processing sends refund amount and date

### Profile Events
- [ ] Test onboarding completion includes `Diabetes_Type`

## Error Handling

All Zoho notifications are wrapped in try-catch blocks with proper logging:

```typescript
try {
  new NotificationProducer(kafka.client).send({...});
  logger.info('Zoho notification sent successfully');
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to send notification to Zoho', { error });
}
```

This ensures that if Zoho API fails, it doesn't break the core subscription/payment flow.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add Fields in Zoho CRM**
   - Use the `ZOHO_FIELDS_TO_ADD.md` file as reference
   - Add all 15 new fields to the Lead module

2. **Get Zoho Credentials**
   - Obtain OAuth credentials from Akash
   - Update notification service configuration

3. **Deploy Changes**
   - Deploy subscription service
   - Deploy profile service
   - Restart services to pick up new code

4. **Test in Staging**
   - Create test scenarios for each event
   - Verify fields are populated in Zoho
   - Check logs for any errors

5. **Monitor Production**
   - Watch notification service logs
   - Monitor Zoho API call success/failure rates
   - Verify data accuracy in Zoho CRM

## Architecture Notes

### Current Pattern (Maintained)
```
Backend Service
    ↓
NotificationProducer (Kafka)
    ↓
Notification Service (Go)
    ↓
Zoho CRM API
```

All notifications follow the existing pattern:
- Use `zohoOnly: true` flag
- Pass `zohoFields` object with field mappings
- Send via `NotificationProducer`
- Go notification service handles API calls

### Why This Works
- ✅ Consistent with existing codebase
- ✅ Centralized error handling in notification service
- ✅ Async processing via Kafka
- ✅ Retries handled by notification service
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing code

---

## Important Notes

1. **Field Names are Case-Sensitive**
   - Zoho API requires exact field name matches
   - Use underscores, not hyphens: `Payment_Failed` ✅ not `Payment-Failed` ❌

2. **Date Format**
   - All dates sent as ISO 8601 format using `formatISO()`
   - Example: `2025-10-08T12:30:00.000Z`

3. **Amount Format**
   - Amounts divided by 100 to convert paise to rupees
   - Example: `49900` paise → `499` rupees

4. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Payment failed consumer checks for duplicates
   - Won't send notification for same payment failure twice

5. **Renewal Detection**
   - Automatically detects if payment failure is for renewal
   - Checks payment history for previous successful payments
